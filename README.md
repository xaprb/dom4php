dom4php
=======

PHP4 DOM parser.

dom4php is a pure PHP library for manipulating XML documents via the Document Object Model. It is written for PHP4. I wrote it long ago and am just putting it on GitHub if it's of interest to anyone.

There's more detail in an [introductory article](http://xaprb.com/blog/2006/10/31/dom4php-a-php-dom-implementation) on my blog. Let me know if there's anything I can do to help you.
